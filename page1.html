<div style="font-size:100%; color:#3b3a3a;font-weight:400;">Jar candles, particularly in old fashioned Mason jars are very popular these days. 
I believe the interest in jar candles may have started with the advent of soy wax candles. 
Soy wax candles have to be poured into a container because it is a soft wax and must be contained.
This means soy wax is not good for making candlesticks or pillars. We often get asked why we don’t make our beeswax candles in jars.
We do put our beeswax in small tins but there is a reason that we don’t make them in deep glass containers.Test         
Beeswax is a naturally hard wax with a very high melting point. It burns much hotter than other candle waxes. A well-made beeswax candle will burn with a bright amber flame unless it does not have enough oxygen.  A candle is deprived of oxygen if it is deep in a jar. This can happen as well if the flame has burned down very far into a pillar and a high beeswax ‘mantle’ has been left around the edges. The flame will then flicker and dance wildly. This can be remedied by folding the edges of your pillar and taking away the mantle. It also helps to keep the wick trimmed at all times. A beeswax votive must be burned in a snug fitting holder but even then it will flicker if the wick isn’t trimmed properly. Both the votive and pillar, if not properly maintained can smoke and leave something you don’t want behind – soot! Yes even beeswax candles will soot if they aren’t well maintained or are burned in improper holders.
